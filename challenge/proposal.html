    <p>Obviously still have a lot of work to do on my proposal, but here is my basic idea.
    <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>Create a build calculator for the popular game, League of Legends (LoL).</p>
        <p>In a LoL match, players earn gold through performing various actions. They use gold to buy items from the item shop, granting their character various upgrades and abilities. 
            The items a player owns and the resulting stats their character has are collectively termed their <i>build</i>.
        </p>
        <p>To date, I have not found a good resource for simulating builds and comparing them against other possible builds. 
            The best way to do this now is to actually launch the game in practice mode and try out different items.
            While this method works, it is somewhat cumbersome, and obviously not suitable for "theory-crafting" away from the player's gaming machine.
